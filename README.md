# keras-nn-tutorial

Basic tutorial for training feed-forward neural networks with back-propagation using Keras. It is an extension of a previous tutorial that focused on neural network training using genetic algorithms: https://github.com/HelgiHelgason/genetic-nn-tutorial

This code learns to approximate the cosine function.
